# Audio-to-Text Prescription

## Overview
Audio-to-Text Prescription is a Python-based tool designed to convert audio input (such as a doctor's spoken prescription) into a structured text prescription. This can help digitize medical prescriptions, improve record-keeping, and streamline the workflow for healthcare professionals.

## Features
- Converts audio prescriptions to text
- Structured output for easy integration with other systems
- Simple command-line interface

## Requirements
See [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) for a full list of dependencies.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Audio-to-text-presciption.git
   cd Audio-to-text-presciption
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your audio file (e.g., `prescription.wav`) in the project directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python prescription.py --audio_file prescription.wav
   ```
   (Adjust the command as per the actual script interface.)
3. The output will be a text file or printed to the console, containing the transcribed prescription.

## Configuration
- You may need to adjust the script to match your audio file format or language.
- For advanced configuration, refer to comments in `prescription.py`.
